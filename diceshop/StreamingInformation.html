            <h3>Streaming</h3>
            Welcome to Elemental Rolls Streaming Information page. Incase you are not aware,
         Elemental Roll is a company made up of a ton of nerds who like to play Tabletop 
         Role Playing Games, many of them actually using dice made by Elemental Roll. 
         And Because of that, we want to help share our nerdiness with the world, 
         in more ways than just sharing dice. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 
         Workers of Elemental Roll volunteer their time willingly to put on a show. 
         Every four month we change game systems, from Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition 
         to Vampire the Masquerade, to Pathfinder, to Call of Cthulhu. Our game is ran by 
         a great group of people.  We have our Game Master, otherwise known as GM, 
         Sam Andersen, CEO, who has been playing tabletop roleplaying games for more than 
         half a decade, and our players, including Isaac Johnsrud, Liam Henretty, Bren Stone, 
         Sara Jane Smith, and Argus Ito. All of us come together to share the joy that we find
         in these games with the rest of the world, as well as model how to play games that may 
         be less popular than others, but by no means less enjoyable to play with your friends. 
         Come on down to join in the fun.
